# nix-otel

![Screenshot of Honeycomb from nix-otel instrumenting building itself](./demo-screenshot.png)

This program shims the Nix logger with a Nix plugin to extract precise timing
for builds from Nix. It has only been tested against [Honeycomb] with
OTLP/gRPC.

[Honeycomb]: https://honeycomb.io

## Setup

### Installation

To install nix-otel, it needs to be passed to Nix in the option `plugin-files`.
[Currently](https://github.com/lf-/nix-otel/issues/3) nix-otel can only run on
the Nix client, so my recommendation is to just use the flake from this
repository and `--option plugin-files`, for now. In the future, it will be able
to run on the daemon so it will be easier to install system wide.

#### Important note

You need to *ensure* that the version of Nix that `nix-otel` is loaded in is
exactly the same as the one it's built against. We [found a strange macOS-only
bug](https://github.com/lf-/nix-otel/pull/12) where `nix-otel` built against a
different copy of Nix 2.11.0 than it was run against would not get any data.

In practice, this means running with the `nix` binary provided by the `nix
develop` shell from this project rather than the system Nix.

### Honeycomb

Set env vars like so in `.envrc.local`:

```
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_APIKEY
```

Then set the Nix configuration option `plugin-files` to include the plugin .so
or .dylib file.

### Jaeger

Use [Jaeger Opentelemetry collector](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-opentelemetry-collector)
Set env vars like so in `.envrc.local`:

```shell
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
```

### Other services

No idea. Sorry. They probably work but might need some minor patches since
[rust-opentelemetry-otlp doesn't support all environment variables
yet](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/issues/774).

## Development

I use nix-direnv and direnv to make this project work across C++ and Rust.

To make rust-analyzer work for you and pick up the right compiler and so on,
you will need to create a wrapper script `direnv-ra` somewhere in your $PATH,
like so:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

direnv exec . rust-analyzer "$@"
```

then set the "rust-analyzer.server.path" variable in your editor settings to
point to it.

### Making the C++ IDE work

This is unnecessarily silly because C++ is bad. Anyway, you can get clangd
working on this project by doing the following:

```
[nix-shell]$ cargo clean -p nix-otel-plugin
[nix-shell]$ bear -- cargo build
```

which will create a `compile_commands.json` with the appropriate contents.

### Running in development

Run in development like so:

```
nix-otel/plugin Â» cargo b && nix --option plugin-files ../target/debug/libnix_otel_plugin.so build ..#
```
